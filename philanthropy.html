    At JMU Alpha Sigma Phi, we run a philanthropy event every year, specifically raising money for RAINN. RAINN's mission is to prevent sexual violence, help victims, and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice. Sexual assault is especially prevalent around college campuses. One event we host is "pie-a-brother", where brothers volunteer on the quad, and people can donate to RAINN to pie a brother in the face!
