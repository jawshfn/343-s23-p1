<p>At JMU Alpha Sigma Phi runs a philanthropy event every year!
     Specifically, we raise money for RAINN!</p>
<p>RAINN is very important to everyone of us, the mission of RAINN is to
    carry out programs to prevent sexual violence, help victims, and
     ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.
</p>
<p>Sexual assault is very real espeically around college campuses.</p>
<p>One event we do is pie-a-brother. Brothers volunteer on the quad where
    people then get to donate to RAINN to pie a brother in the face!

    is a child.
